##section [ title = Introduction ]

&p This document will in time be expanded to a full discussion of the bensalem
   markup language and library system. It's written in syntactically-valid
   bensalem, with suggestive (but presently undefined) element names.

##section [ title = Bensalem surface and core languages ]

&p The core of bensalem is a minimalist set of markup constructs that can be
   rendered to a variety of output formats. The surface language is a much
   larger set of constructs, including user-defined elements that have
   associated mappings to the core language. With the surface language, the user
   can create a rich semantic language for their documents that is still widely
   and easily displayed. Some of the core elements include:

&dl
  &di Plain text
  &di Highlights
  &di Lists
  &di Tables
  &di Notes
  &di Figures
  &di General textual divisions
  &di Choice elements


##section [ title = Syntax reference ]

&p Bensalem, like other mixed-content markup languages, is a programming
   language with unmarked strings and marked commands.
